It is made up of a few simple endpoints that demonstrate our understanding of full stack software engineering basics, such as designing and building a database and API in Ruby On Rails, using TDD to create back end routes and the necessary logic to manipulate the data held therein, as well as making calls to the database and handling the returned data using in a React.js app.
